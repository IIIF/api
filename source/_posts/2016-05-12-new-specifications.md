The IIIF Editors are pleased to announce revised versions of the Image and Presentation APIs:

 * [IIIF Image API 2.1.0][image21]
 * [IIIF Presentation API 2.1.0][prezi21]

These are minor revisions which do not impose any backward-incompatible changes, and reflect 20 months of refinement based on community feedback and implementation. Changes are described in the [Image API Change Log][image21-changes] and [Presentation API Change Log][prezi21-changes].

Additionally, we would like to announce the first release of the [IIIF Search API][search10]. This API defines a syntax for searching within resources and is designed to be idiomatic to annotations that are implemented as described the IIIF Presentation API.

Thank you, as always, to the IIIF community for your feedback, questions, and use cases. New questions and use cases are always welcome, and we encourage you to submit them to the [IIIF Discussion Listserv](mailto:{{ site.data.organization.email }}).

Sincerely,

The IIIF Editors
