Do you work with digital images on the web? Join the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) community the week of 5 June for two exciting events in The Vatican! Registration closes on 22 May, 2017.

## IIIF Showcase: Unlocking the World’s Digital Images
**[Register Now][showcase-reg]**

**[View Schedule][showcase-sched]**

Join the [IIIF community][community] on Tuesday, 6 June in The Vatican, for the **IIIF Showcase: Unlocking the World’s Digital Images**, a one-day event featuring the basics and benefits of IIIF for both institutions and end users. Embraced by a growing number of the world’s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for organizations to publish their image-based resources with reduced cost and time, while simultaneously improving end user experience with a new host of rich and dynamic features such as image manipulation and annotation.

[Showcase event][showcase-reg] topics will include:

* An overview of the IIIF community, APIs, software, and examples of IIIF projects and content
* IIIF benefits for digital image repositories and image providers
* Advanced interactive functionality for researchers, scholars, and other end users
* How to get started with IIIF
* How to join the IIIF community and get involved

Schedule information for the Showcase is available via [Sched][showcase-sched]. This event will be valuable for organizational decision makers, repository and collection managers, software engineers; for cultural heritage or STEM (science / technology / engineering / medicine) institutions; or for anyone engaged with image-based resources on the Web. It is intended for people who have not been involved with IIIF in the past to quickly get up to speed and understand the community and its benefits. Attendance is free, and widespread dissemination of the event is encouraged. [Registration][showcase-reg] is required to ensure that we do not exceed the capacity of the venue.
