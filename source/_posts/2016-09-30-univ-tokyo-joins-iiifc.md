Although new to the Consortium, the University of Tokyo has been involved with IIIF for some time. Dr. Kiyonori Nagasaki of the [International Institute for Digital Humanities][iidh]  has been a leading advocate for IIIF in Japan, disseminating information about IIIF through [blogs][blogs] written in Japanese, introducing students to IIIF in his digital humanities classes at the University, and implementing the [IIIF APIs][apis] in the [国デコ Image Wall][image-wall] for viewing digital images of paintings and drawings from around Japan from the year 1200 - 1944. Dr. Nagasaki also recently presented a [workshop on IIIF][workshop] at the annual conference of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities at the University of Tokyo on September 12. Additionally, Professor Masahiro Shimoda of the University of Tokyo has led a project to implement the IIIF [Image][image] and [Presentation][prezi] APIs in the [SAT Taishōzō Image DB][sat] in order to promote Buddhist studies in the digital realm.
