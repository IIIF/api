All IIIF events and interactions are covered by the following Code of Conduct.

---

IIIF is an inclusive, friendly and safe collaboration opportunity.  It has always been committed to openness and transparency in all that it does: code, designs, discussions. We are equally committed to helpful and respectful communication both in person and via the internet.

IIIF and its members are dedicated to providing a harassment-free collaboration experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including event presentations, email lists, teleconferences, and social events. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the event or community coordinators, and their details provided to partner institutions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other communication, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked, by anyone, to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or immediate expulsion from the event or communication channel. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event or community coordination team immediately. The community coordination team can be contacted directly at [iiif-admin@googlegroups.com][admin].

At physical events, staff may be identified by name badges or introductions at the beginning, and will help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
