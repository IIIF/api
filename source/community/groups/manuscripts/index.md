The IIIF Manuscripts Group formed following an [IIIF meeting in Ghent][ghent], Belgium in December 2015. Attendees at the Ghent meeting agreed that there needed to be a separate IIIF interest group focused on the experience of users working with images of hand-written materials in particular. 

The IIIF is a constantly expanding community; it covers a range of disciplines, institutions, research and national libraries, and non足profit image repositories. IIIF Manuscripts currently welcomes participation from all IIIF repositories with manuscript materials, scholars working with hand-written materials, and software developers interested in the particular problems presented by those materials.

The IIIF MSS Group seeks to advance aims of the [IIIF足C][iiifc], which are to reduce inefficiency and needless redundancy born from incompatibility in the current image delivery ecosystem. We are committed to furthering the goals of the IIIF:

  * To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image足 based resources hosted around the world.
  * To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.
  * To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients that provide a world足class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.

The IIIF MSS Group also has its own specific goals:

  * To keep interested institutions and projects up to date on advances in the IIIF initiative as they affect users of digitized manuscripts
  * To provide feedback to the IIIF community on repository and user experience from the perspective of manuscript curators and scholars
  * To devise, organize, and promote noteworthy scholarship based on interoperable digitized manuscript data.
