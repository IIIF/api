## 1. Introduction

As the IIIF community grows, the diversity of the participants' interests and expertise is increasing at the same time as the ability to manage the work done within the community becomes more complex. Tracking the many threads of effort is a challenge, let alone ensuring that different organizations are not working independently on the same issue, or worse at cross-purposes.   There is a strong desire amongst the participants to increase the visibility of their projects in order to encourage ongoing participation, and thereby prevent duplication of effort.  To realize this goal, while remaining a distributed and peer-oriented organization, requires overlaying some additional structure to assist in coalescing and managing the tasks.

This document lays out a framework asserting the least possible management structure while remaining effective.  It is derived from the Hydra Project structure, which is in turn informed by the experiences and guidelines of related organizations, including the W3C, the Research Data Alliance, and the Apache Software Foundation.

## 2. Requirements

The community framework must meet the following requirements:

1. It must be lightweight enough that work is not prevented from being done

2. It must facilitate visibility and discovery of ongoing, beneficial work

3. It must allow other work within the community to take place outside of the structure

4. It must enable new participants to join in with ongoing development

5. It must encourage the development of products by the community

6. It must be fair and equitable with regards to any decision making process

## 3. Community Group Framework

Leveraging the open community mentality in which participation is the most important feature is necessary to ensure the continued growth and success of IIIF.  By formalizing and providing guidance to the existing processes and groups, it is possible to increase the groups' visibility and likelihood of success.  That is to say, structure is not being imposed for the sake of having structure but guidance and assistance is provided to enhance the benefits of emergent community best practices.

Successful groups:

* Are based on mutual respect

* Entail a commitment to share expertise, effort and engagement

* Are deeply and continually engaged with the wider IIIF community to ensure that shared requirements are first understood and then met

* Encourage self-selection of participants, in a supportive, inclusive environment that fosters participation and contributions from throughout the community

* Develop high quality products in a reasonable, documented timeframe

These features, combined with the requirements above, result in the following model of separate Interest Groups (IG) for surfacing the general areas of concern in the community and ensuring ongoing engagement with common topics, and Working Groups (WG) for working together towards specific, agreed-upon results.

## 4. IIIF Interest Groups

Interest Groups, as contrasted with Working Groups, are for discussion rather than developing specific deliverables.  It is expected that Working Groups will be formed out of Interest Groups as requirements emerge from the conversations.

  

### Interest Group Formation

* Interest Groups can be formed as needed. A lightweight statement of the topic, the scope and objectives of discussion of the interest group should be documented on the iiif.io website, and at least one channel for communication noted.

* Interest Groups are approved by the IIIF Coordinating Committee, based on the statement above.  IGs should not be formed without some level of need within the community. 

* Interest Groups may provide input towards chartering one or more Working Groups to accomplish specific objectives.

### Interest Group Requirements

* At least three organizations must be represented in an interest group. One of those organizations must be a IIIF Consortium member. Anyone may be part of an IG.  

* The discussions of the interest group must be transparent and public, and the channels used for communication must be published. There may be situations where either the discussion takes place offline or is not suitable for public dissemination.  These sorts of discussions are not expected to be common.

* The primary channel of communication for all IGs is the iiif-discuss list. New lists should be formed only when the traffic is too high for useful discussion. Each interest group should also maintain an active presence in a IIIF Slack channel.

* Interest groups should be constantly active, but may still exist while all of the participants are temporarily inactive.  

### Interest Group Dissolution

Interest groups can be dissolved if the participants decide that the topic has been explored.  The document describing the group should be updated to state this termination of the group, and otherwise left intact for future reference.

## 5. Working Groups

Working Groups are the main working vehicle within the IIIF Community and may stand alone or be born out of existing WGs or IGs.  They are typically created to perform specific tasks in a defined realm and timescale, thereby allowing collaborative work to flourish in a structured environment.

### Working Group Formation

Working Groups should be able to be convened with a minimum of effort, while still allowing participants to understand what they are signing up for. The group should emerge naturally from discussions and needs within the community, while not penalizing individuals or organizations that were not part of those initial discussions.  Participants in discussions that show promise of inter-institutional convergence and the possibility of joint development work should document the shared needs and requirements in a Google document following an available template. Once finalized, this document will be maintained as a record of the WG on the iiif.io website. 

The documentation process should result in a common understanding of:

1. The overall domain into which the work will fall

2. The shared needs and requirements within that domain

3. Use cases that demonstrate these needs and requirements

4. A path towards one or more products that would meet the requirements

5. The organizations willing to commit resources towards realizing the product(s)

6. The timeframe in which the product(s) are needed and should be possible

This document, henceforth the charter, provides the definition of the working group and its deliverables.  It is not a contract and may be changed with the consensus of the members of the working group at any time, however significant changes such as a 6 month or more delay in timeframes, the abandonment of a deliverable, or the change in the overall scope of the work should be announced to the community via the regular channels.

### Working Group Approval

Once the draft charter is acceptable to the participants in the discussion, a Call for Participation (CfP) issued.  This is simply an email to appropriate lists, including at least iiif-discuss, that announces the document and seeks the engagement of additional participants. Organizations must respond to that email that they are willing to take part and commit resources towards the working group's goals.  At least three IIIF Consortium members must respond positively, and no more than three institutions may respond negatively, for the working group to be approved.  If fewer than three institutions are willing to contribute, then the working group's topic is likely too specific and the work should be done outside of the Working Group process.  If more than three institutions object to the work being done, then there is a significant issue that should be resolved before committing resources.

For working groups where deliverables would involve additions or changes to the technical specifications already published, then at least two current members of the editorial board must sign up as members of the working group to ensure consistency with existing and ongoing work.

At least two calendar weeks must pass between the CfP and the working group being approved.  If there are only one or two institutions are interested after four calendar weeks, then the CfP is ended and the charter should be discussed and modified before re-announcing. 

Once the working group is approved, the link to the charter will be added to the IIIF community page that lists active working groups (http://iiif.io/community/groups/).

### Working Group Requirements

All members of a working group must agree to have any contributed work licensed under a CC-BY license, or similar.  Participants meeting this requirement may join at any time, without any prior approval process: the gateway is activity, not reputation.

All discussion within the working group must be transparent.  This means that meetings must have notes taken about the attendance and any decisions or action items, general discussions take place on mailing lists maintained by the community, chat logs should be posted and so forth.  Any meetings, face-to-face or by teleconference, at which decisions are made must be announced in advance and open to any working group participant, otherwise any opinions expressed at the meeting must also be discussed on a mailing list.  Meeting times should be published far enough in advance to allow members to schedule their participation, and preferably use a consistent schedule. Every participant is encouraged to take an active role in ensuring the transparency of the work.

Working Groups must remain active. Any working group that does not respond to comments, questions or concerns either from participants or the community will be removed from the list of active working groups.  

Working Groups must strive to meet their timelines and produce the deliverables designated in their charter.  

The WG must always have at least one member designated as Chair, and preferably two or at most three.  Chairs are responsible for promoting continued activity within the group but have no additional powers or rights than any other participant.  Chairs do not need to be from a IIIF Consortium member organization. A WG with only inactive chairs is considered to be inactive, and the group should select one or more new chairs.

Working Groups may self-organize in the most convenient manner to accomplish their tasks, including creation and assignment of additional roles and responsibilities as appropriate.  Sub groups may be formed and disbanded at will, consisting only of members of the WG, often called Task Forces. They do not need to separately meet the requirements of the WG, such as having their own Chair or Consortium members.

### Working Group Dissolution

Working groups are dissolved under the following circumstances:

* All of the deliverables have been met. Hooray!

* The group becomes inactive

* The group does not have participants from three or more IIIF Consortium member institutions

* The group does not have anyone willing to be the Chair

At such a time as a group is dissolved, it is moved from the active list of working groups into a working group archive page with the reason for its dissolution noted.  

## 6. Community Channels

The following enumerate the current community channels for communication:

* Mailing Lists:

    * iiif-discuss

    * iiif-announce 	

* IIIF Slack

* IIIF GitHub repositories

Working and Interest groups should use an existing channel unless and until it becomes clear that a dedicated channel is needed.  If and when a dedicated channel is needed, the new channel should be well publicized and open to any interested subscribers/participants in the community.   When using a shared channel, individual working groups should start the subject line with their name in []s, such as [av] for the Audio/Visual Working Group.

## 7. Standing Groups

The following groups are standing, and cannot be dissolved.

### Coordinating Committee

The Coordinating Committee (CoCo) is responsible for organization and maintenance of the community, such as organizing outreach and plenary working sessions, maintaining the IIIF web sites and soliciting additions, inviting and welcoming new participants to the community, and so forth.  Each institution can have at most two representatives on CoCo, but Consortium membership is not required, only activity.

The initial members of the Coordinating Committee are:

* Michael Appleby (YCBA)

* Tom Cramer (Stanford, Chair)

* Tom Crane (Digirati)

* Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass (YCBA)

* Karen Estlund (Penn State)

* Christy Henshaw (Wellcome)

* Mark Matienzo (DPLA)

* Matthew McGrattan (Oxford)

* Glen Robson (National Library of Wales)

* Robert Sanderson (Getty Trust)

* Stu Snydman (Stanford)

* Jon Stroop (Princeton)

* Simeon Warner (Cornell)

Additionally, IG and WG chairs are automatically invited if they are not already part of the group, even if that would break the two person per institution limit. This is initially:

* Benjamin Albritton (Stanford, Manuscripts)

* Jason Ronallo (NC State, AV)

* Tina Shah (Art Institute of Chicago, Museums

The members of the Editorial Board (below) and the chair of the IIIF Consortium Executive Committee are permanent members of the Coordinating Committee.  New members may be added at any time based on activity and agreement of the current committee members.

### Editorial Board

The Editorial Board is responsible for maintaining and overseeing the improvement of the technical specifications produced by the community.  The Editorial Board will ensure that changes proposed to the specifications through the deliverables of Working Groups are consistent with established best practices and justified by shared use cases.  They are responsible for the final text of the specifications, even if that is identical to the text provided by a WG.

The initial members of the Editorial Board are:

* Michael Appleby (YCBA)

* Tom Crane (Digirati)

* Rob Sanderson (Getty Trust)

* Jon Stroop (Princeton)

* Simeon Warner (Cornell)

The working requirements and practices for the Editorial Board are documented separately: [http://iiif.io/api/annex/notes/editors/](http://iiif.io/api/annex/notes/editors/)
