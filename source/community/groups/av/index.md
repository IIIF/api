## About

The IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group aims to extend to A/V the benefits of interoperability and the growing ecosystem of clients and servers that IIIF provides for images. The A/V specification group was formed following a workshop hosted by the British Library to gather [use cases for extending IIIF to audio and video][bl-workshop-2016-04], and discussion at the [2016 IIIF Conference][iiif-conf-2016] in New York City. At the Fall 2016 working meeting in The Hague, the group focused on determining an initial set of features. The A/V group welcomes contributions to their collection of [audiovisual user stories][av-user-stories] and mockups and prototypes.
