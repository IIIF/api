## 1. Introduction

The ideas of Time and Place are a foundation of human communication and understanding. These concepts are first class descriptors for resources and the ability to capture both independently is often required for data presentation and preservation. In IIIF Presentation API 3 the property `navDate` allows for a calendar date to be associated with a resource in a client friendly format. However, locations are extents in space, independent of time and what may or may not be present in that space. 


### 1.1 Objectives and Scope

IIIF provides the information necessary to allow a rich, online viewing environment for compound digital objects to be presented to a human user. The types of resources and their specific needs continue to enhance the IIIF specifications to greater resource coverage. The ability to assert ancillary information is a universal need in this expanse. This is achieved using Annotation, or Web Annotation, and extensions across the IIIF specification versions.

This extension describes a property called `navPlace` which contains geographic coordinates in the form of [GeoJSON-LD](https://geojson.org/geojson-ld/). Clients may use this property to leverage the navigational functionality of web maps such as Google Earth, Leaflet, OpenLayers, etc. giving them the opportunity to enrich data presentation through common web map platform projections of the surface of the Earth.


### 1.2 Motivating Use Cases

The reasons for associating geographic coordinates with web resources vary greatly. This extension does not intend to meet the data requirements for all geospatial practices. Use cases within the scope include



*   Link a IIIF resource to a single or multiple geographic areas on a web map
*   Supply a single geographic bounding box for an image of a map
*   Track locations listed in an itinerary or travel journal

Situations which are not in scope include


*   Spatiotemporal alignment with the place, as in a timeline or specific placement because of time
*   Georeferencing to overlay maps or warp maps into coordinate space
*   3D spatial representation
*   [Application of geospatial information to resource fragments](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0139-geolocate-canvas-fragment/)


### 1.3 Terminology

This specification uses the following terms:

* __embedded__: When a resource (A) is embedded within an embedding resource (B), the complete JSON representation of resource A is present within the JSON representation of resource B, and dereferencing the URI of resource A will not result in additional information. Example: Canvas A is embedded in Manifest B.
* __referenced__: When a resource (A) is referenced from a referencing resource (B), an incomplete JSON representation of resource A is present within the JSON representation of resource B, and dereferencing the URI of resource A will result in additional information. Example:  Manifest A is referenced from Collection B.
* __HTTP(S)__: The HTTP or HTTPS URI scheme and internet protocol.

The terms _array_, _JSON object_, _number_, _string_, and _boolean_ in this document are to be interpreted as defined by the [Javascript Object Notation (JSON)][org-rfc-8259] specification.

The key words _MUST_, _MUST NOT_, _REQUIRED_, _SHALL_, _SHALL NOT_, _SHOULD_, _SHOULD NOT_, _RECOMMENDED_, _MAY_, and _OPTIONAL_ in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][org-rfc-2119].


## 2. GeoJSON-LD and the `navPlace` Property


### 2.1 GeoJSON

This extension implements the [GeoJSON-LD specification](https://geojson.org/geojson-ld/) and so its values follow the [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) conventions for Feature Collections. The possible geometric shapes are those defined by GeoJSON Feature `geometry` values. All geographic coordinates are in [WGS84](http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos) format.


#### 2.1.1 GeoJSON as Linked Data

The GeoJSON terms, the IIIF Presentation API 3 terms, and the `navPlace` term all require linked data context for `navPlace` to be IIIF compatible. This is elaborated upon in [section 3](#3-linked-data).



```json-doc
{
    "@context":[ 
       "http://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/context.json",
       "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json"
    ]
}
```


#### 2.1.2 Feature

A Feature object represents a spatial bounding. Every Feature object is a GeoJSON object.



*   A Feature object has a `type` property with the value "Feature".
*   A Feature object has a property with the name `geometry`. The value of the `geometry` property _SHALL_ be either a Geometry object as defined above or, in the case that the Feature is unlocated, a JSON null value.
*   A Feature object has a property with the name `properties`. The value of the `properties` property is an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).
*   If a Feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier _SHOULD_ be included as a property of the Feature object with the name `id`. The value _MUST_ be a string, and the value _MUST_ be an HTTP(S) URI [as defined by the IIIF Presentation API 3](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#61-uri-recommendations).


#### 2.1.3 Feature Collection

A Feature Collection object represents an aggregation of spatial boundings.



*   A Feature Collection object has a `type` property with the value "FeatureCollection".
*   A Feature Collection object has a property with the name `features`. The value of `features` is a JSON array. Each element of the array is a Feature object as defined above. It is possible for this array to be empty, but when used in the context of this extension it _SHOULD NOT_ be empty.
*   If a Feature Collection has a commonly used identifier, that identifier _SHOULD_ be included as a property of the Feature Collection object with the name `id`. The value _MUST_ be a string, and the value _MUST_ be an HTTP(S) URI [as defined by the IIIF Presentation API 3](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#61-uri-recommendations).

#### 2.1.4 Position

A position is the fundamental geometry construct and contains a `coordinates` property. A position is an array of numbers. There _MUST_ be two or more elements. The first two elements are longitude and latitude, or easting and northing, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers. Altitude or elevation _MAY_ be included as an optional third element.


#### 2.1.5 Table of Geometric Shapes

| Geometry Object  |    Description| 
|----|----|
| Point  |  The "coordinates" property is a single position| 
| MultiPoint |  The "coordinates" property is an array of positions| 
| LineString |  The "coordinates" property is an array of two or more positions| 
| MultiLineString   |   The "coordinates" property is an array of LineString coordinate arrays| 
| Polygon   |   The "coordinates" property _MUST_ be an array of linear ring coordinate arrays. For Polygons with more than one of these rings, the first _MUST_ be the exterior ring, and any others _MUST_ be interior rings. The exterior ring bounds the surface, and the interior rings (if present) bound holes within the surface.| 
| MultiPolygon  |   The "coordinates" property is an array of Polygon coordinate arrays| 
| GeometryCollection  | Has a property with the name "geometries". The value of "geometries" is an array. Each element of this array is a GeoJSON Geometry object. It is possible for this array to be empty. | 
{: .api-table}

For examples of these shapes, see the “Examples” section of the GeoJSON specification at [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#appendix-A](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#appendix-A)


### 2.2 `navPlace` Property

The `navPlace` property identifies a single or multiple geographic areas pertinent to a resource using a GeoJSON Feature Collection containing one or more Features. A Feature represents a shape by using the geographic coordinates supplied in the `geometry` property. The shape does not imply any level of precision, fuzziness, temporality or state of existence. 

The `navPlace` property can be used with the [IIIF Presentation 3 API Defined Types](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#21-defined-types)



*   A Collection _MAY_ have the `navPlace` property.<br/>
   Clients _MAY_ render `navPlace` on a Collection.
*   A Manifest _MAY_ have the `navPlace` property.<br/>
   Clients _MAY_ render `navPlace` on a Manifest.
*   A Range _MAY_ have the `navPlace` property.<br/>
   Clients _MAY_ render `navPlace` on a Range.
*   A Canvas _MAY_ have the `navPlace` property.<br/>
   Clients _MAY_ render `navPlace` on a Canvas.
*   Other types of resource _MUST NOT_ have the `navPlace` property.<br/>
   Clients _SHOULD_ ignore `navPlace` on other types of resource.

The `navPlace` property's value follows a specific pattern.



*   The value _MUST_ be a single GeoJSON-LD Feature Collection and _SHOULD_ contain at least one Feature.
*   The Feature Collection that is the value of `navPlace` _MAY_ have an `id`.
*   The Features within the Feature Collection _MAY_ have an `id`, and the `id` _MAY_ be the URI of the Feature Collection with a unique fragment on the end.
*   A Feature or Feature Collection that has the `id` property _MAY_ be accessible by the URI. 
*   Feature Collections and Feature objects inside of Feature Collections _MUST NOT_ be NULL. 
*   The value for `navPlace` _SHOULD_ be an embedded GeoJSON Feature Collection object. However, the value _MAY_ be a referenced GeoJSON Feature Collection. 
*   Feature Collections referenced in the `navPlace` property _MUST_ have the `id` and `type` properties.
*   The reference object _MUST NOT_ have the `features` property, such that clients are able to recognize that it should be retrieved in order to be processed.</br> 
`{"navPlace":{"id": "https://example.org/iiif/1/feature-collection", "type": "FeatureCollection"}}`


`navPlace` is intended to connect IIIF web resources with geographic areas. These areas _SHOULD_ be bounded discrete regions of the map akin to extents. `navPlace` is not meant for geographic layouts at the township, city, country or continental level. Such descriptive datasets rely heavily on the client map viewer API for displaying connected metadata directly to the user. It is up to the implementer to determine how their chosen web map viewer interacts with GeoJSON data nodes and whether or not their metadata belongs in `properties` to be displayed as desired. For more on using metadata with this pattern see section [3.3](#33-context-considerations-for-geojson-ld-properties).

```json-doc
{
   "navPlace":{
      "id": "http://example.com/feature-collection/1",
      "type": "FeatureCollection",
      "features":[
         {
            "id": "http://example.com/feature/1",
            "type": "Feature",
            "properties":{},
            "geometry":{
               "type": "Point",
               "coordinates":[
                  9.94,
                  51.53
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```


## 3. Linked Data


### 3.1 Linked Data Context


*   The URI of the `navPlace` linked data context is [`http://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/context.json`](http://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/context.json)
*   The URI of the IIIF Presentation API 3 linked data context is [`http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json`](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json)

The navPlace extension linked data context _MUST_ be included before the IIIF Presentation API 3 linked data context on the top-level object. The navPlace extension context file includes the [GeoJSON-LD context](https://geojson.org/geojson-ld/geojson-context.jsonld) through context scoping. This means the GeoJSON-LD context URI does not have to be explicitly included on the top level object, unless GeoJSON is used in other properties besides `navPlace`. It is important to note that since the IIIF Presentation API 3 context has the JSON-LD `@version` set to 1.1, all contexts are processed as JSON-LD 1.1.  

Consult the [Linked Data Context and Extensions section of IIIF Presentation API 3](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#46-linked-data-context-and-extensions) for further guidance on use of the `@context` property.

### 3.2 Full Manifest Example

Here you can see an example of a IIIF Manifest with the `navPlace` property. It is made JSON-LD 1.1 compatible by including multiple contexts. Review the Manifest below in the [JSON-LD playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/) for an example of Linked Data processing.

         }
      ]
   }
}
```


### 3.3 Context Considerations for GeoJSON-LD `properties`

The GeoJSON `properties` object is generic and can be nearly anything. It is used to pass metadata along with the geographic coordinates. Web maps offer common ways for implementers to generate UI(s) for displaying values in `properties` along with the shape made by the geographic coordinates. IIIF encourages interoperability, which is made possible in large part due to Linked Data. Any metadata used in `properties` _SHOULD_ be described by a linked data context. Desired metadata already noted by a property on a IIIF resource _SHOULD_ be gathered by consuming that property for the web map UI and _MAY_ be repeated in GeoJSON `properties` to leverage automated functionality. The [full Manifest](https://preview.iiif.io/api/navplace_extension/api/extension/navplace/#32-full-manifest-example) below exemplifies this.

Note that if a client discovers a property that it does not understand, then it _MUST_ ignore that property. You can see this functionality by including your own metadata in the `properties` property of the example Manifest and taking it to the [JSON-LD playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/).


## 4. Implementation Notes


### 4.1 GeoJSON-LD on the Web

The choice to use GeoJSON-LD is not arbitrary. It is the primary geocoordinate data format supported by web maps. Too often, poorly formatted datasets are programmatically transformed into GeoJSON as a shim into web maps in order to preserve the original data format. This specification drives implementers to have geocoordinate data saved as GeoJSON-LD when it is intended for use on the web. This practice removes barriers for interoperable geocoordinate data and standardized web map software as well as promotes the robust functionality of prior, current, and upcoming web map developments.


### 4.2 IIIF Cookbook

The [IIIF Cookbook](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/) serves as a place to exemplify implementations of digital objects under IIIF Presentation API 3. At the release of this specification, recipes were already underway. You can see an implementation of the `navPlace` property as a "for demonstration only" preview at [https://preview.iiif.io/cookbook/0154-geo-extension/recipe/0154-geo-extension/](https://preview.iiif.io/cookbook/0154-geo-extension/recipe/0154-geo-extension/). This specification will update with links to recipes as they are published.
