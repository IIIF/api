## Changes for Image API Version 2.0

With the [2.0 of the IIIF Image API](/api/image/2.0), we will begin using [Semantic Versioning][semver]. As the API relies on predictable URI patterns in serveral areas, the editors have made careful choices about which details of the version will be expressed and where. This is explained in [Appendix B][iiif-versioning].

The remaining changes are descibed below, broken into two groups: Breaking Changes and Other (i.e. non-breaking) Changes.

### Breaking Changes
