This document is a companion to the [IIIF Presentation API Specification, Version 2.1.1][prezi-api]. It describes the editorial changes to the API made in this patch release. The changes are all clarifications, typo corrections or to related documents that are not [semantically versioned][semver] such as example resources and resources to manage transformation to and from the JSON-LD serialization.

For the significant changes between 2.0 and 2.1, please see the [2.1 Change Log][changelog-21].
