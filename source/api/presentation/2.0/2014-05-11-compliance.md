## NOTES 

* protocol? "This ... is Triple I F."
* profile for presentation should be defined in terms of features that client needs to be able to support in order to render the manifest.  As such should it be client capabilities required?
* range subclasses  (toc, start)
* document structure?

* Extension contexts should be first; then IIIF will re-overide any fuckups

* Check Media Frags only allows integers.  A bit screwed with canvases that need floats?
