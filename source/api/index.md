## Community Cookbook

The [Cookbook][annex-cookbook] gathers together examples of how to create IIIF Presentation API assets, in order to:

 * Provide many more examples than the specification alone can do, for reference and learning;
 * Encourage publishers to adopt common patterns in modeling classes of complex objects;
 * Enable client software developers to support these patterns, for consistency of user experience (when desirable); and
 * Demonstrate the applicability of IIIF to a broad range of use cases.

The [Cookbook][annex-cookbook] webpages are under constant development and the list of recipes include links to completed recipes and place holders for future recipes. The community welcomes additions to the [Cookbook][annex-cookbook]. To get started, review the [Cookbook process][recipe-process] and say hello on the Cookbook [Slack][slack] channel. 

## Older Versions

Current IIIF specifications _SHOULD_ be used for all new work. Old versions are retained for reference and are listed below. Technical resources and reference implementations of older versions are _NOT_ guaranteed to be maintained across new major versions.

## Notes

IIIF also has a series of [Implementation Notes][annex-notes] which are not subject to the same process as formal APIs but may be useful to implementers.

## Process

IIIF Specifications are created and published following the [IIIF Editorial Process][editorial-process].
