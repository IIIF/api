## 1. Introduction

This is one of a number of [IIIF registries][registry-home]. It lists a set of services that have been identified as useful for implementations, across the APIs.  They may be defined by the IIIF community, or outside of it.

### 1.1. Disclaimer

The inclusion of entries in this document that are outside of the IIIF domain _MUST NOT_ be interpreted as endorsement, support, or approval from the editors, the IIIF community or any individual. This annex is provided as a registry to advertise the existence of these extensions and attempt to ensure some consistency between implementations for common but not universal requirements.

### 1.2. Inclusion Process 

The process for having a new entry added to this registry is [described here][registry-process].

## 2. Requirements for Inclusion

## 3. Registry

This table summarizes the services available and which APIs they may be used in.  The '![not allowed][icon-na]' icon means that the service is not to be used in the API. The '![recommended][icon-recc]' icon means that the service can be used in the API.

| Service                        | Image API                 | Presentation API          |

### 3.1 Image Information
_Added: 2014-05-20_

The Image Information service allows the [Presentation API][prezi-api], and potentially other APIs, to reference content to be displayed via the [Image API][image-api].  The JSON-LD content to be referenced or embedded is the Image Information document, also known as `info.json`.  The service _MUST_ have the `@context`, `@id` and `profile` keys, pointing to the context document, service base URI and compliance level profile respectively.

``` json-doc
{
  "service": {
    "@context" : "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/context.json",
    "@id" : "http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234",
    "profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/level2.json"
  }
}
```

The service _MAY_ have additional information embedded from the Image Information document to avoid the need to retrieve and parse it separately.  In this case, the profile _MAY_ also point to the profile of what functionality is supported, as described in the Image API.

``` json-doc
{
  "service": {
    "@context" : "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/context.json",
    "@id" : "http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234",
    "protocol": "http://iiif.io/api/image",
    "width" : 6000,
    "height" : 4000,
    "sizes" : [
      {"width" : 150, "height" : 100},
      {"width" : 600, "height" : 400},
      {"width" : 3000, "height": 2000}
    ],
    "tiles": [
      {"width" : 512, "scaleFactors" : [1,2,4,8,16]}
    ],
    "profile" : [
      "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/level2.json",
      {
        "formats" : [ "gif", "pdf" ],
        "qualities" : [ "color", "gray" ],
        "supports" : [
            "canonicalLinkHeader", "rotationArbitrary", "http://example.com/feature"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With the `logo` property added to the Image Information description in version 2.1 of the Image API{% unless site.image_api.latest.major >= 2 and site.image_api.latest.minor >= 1 %} (forthcoming){% endunless %}, it is possible and reasonable for one `info.json` response to embed another using this pattern.  In this case, the second service is related to the icon that should be displayed when a client renders the image described by the main response.

``` json-doc
{
  "@context" : "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/context.json",
  "@id" : "http://www.example.org/image-service/baseImage",
  "protocol" : "http://iiif.io/api/image",

  "attribution" : "Provided by Example Organization",
  "logo" : {
    "@id": "http://example.org/image-service/logo/full/full/0/default.png",
    "service": {
      "@id": "http://example.org/image-service/logo",
      "protocol": "http://iiif.io/api/image",
      "profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/{{ site.image_api.latest.major }}/level2.json"
    }
  }
}
```
