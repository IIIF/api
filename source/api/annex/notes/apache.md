## Allow Encoded Slashes

As [specified in the Image API][uri-encoding-and-decoding], slashes ("`/`", "`\`") in the identifer portion of the base uri MUST be encoded. This may cause problems with some HTTP servers. Apache servers from version 2.2.18 support the `AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode` [configuration directive][apache-aesnd] which will correctly pass these characters to client applications without rejecting or decoding them.

``` apacheconf
AllowEncodedSlashes On
```
{: .urltemplate}

Servers using older versions of Apache and local identifiers which include these characters will need to use a workaround such as internally translating or escaping slash and backslash to safe value (perhaps by double URI-encoding them).

## Enabling CORS

Both specifications prefer to have cross-origin resource sharing enabled. This may be enabled with the following configuration snippet:

``` apacheconf
LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
```
{: .urltemplate}

## Set Compliance Link Header

The Image API states that a server [may indicate its compliance level in a link header][image-compliance-levels]. This can be done as follows:

``` apacheconf
Header set Link '<http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level1.json>;rel="profile"'
```
{: .urltemplate}

## Conditional Content Types

Both the [Image][image-api] and [Presentation][prezi-api] APIs state that clients may request JSON-LD, as opposed to plain JSON.

In the Image API, this may be enabled with the following configuration snippet (note that this assumes the compliance level Link header has been set [as above][set-compliance-link-header]):

``` apacheconf
<FilesMatch "\.json">
    SetEnvIf Accept "application/ld\+json" WANTS_jsonld
    Header set Content-Type "application/ld+json" env=WANTS_jsonld
    Header append Link '<http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json>;rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context";type="application/ld+json"' env=!WANTS_jsonld
</FilesMatch>
```
{: .urltemplate}

The above configuration snippet may also be used for Presentation API implementations that have URIs ending in `.json`, but the line starting `Header append Link` should be deleted and it will not work for the recommended URI pattern. The following snippet will work for the recommended patterns:

``` apacheconf
<LocationMatch "^/prefix/(collection/.*|.*/manifest|.*/(sequence|canvas|annotation|list|range|layer)/.*)$">
    SetEnvIf Accept "application/ld\+json" WANTS_jsonld
    Header set Content-Type "application/json"
    Header set Content-Type "application/ld+json" env=WANTS_jsonld
</LocationMatch>
```
{: .urltemplate}
