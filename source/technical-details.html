              This page is a quick-start guide for image repository managers and engineers who are interested in making
              their image repository interoperable, or just experimenting with IIIF.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic steps to getting started with IIIF are:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Deploy an image server that supports the <a href="http://www-sul.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/1.1/" target="_blank">IIIF Image API v1.1</a></li>
              <li>Publish metadata about your image-based objects that complies to <a href="http://www.shared-canvas.org/datamodel/iiif/metadata-api.html" target="_blank">IIIF Metadata API v1.0</a></li>
              <li>Deploy and integrate software that allows you to discover and display IIIF-compliant image resources</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <!-- Step 2 -->
          <section class="step step-1 wrapper">
            <h2>Deploy an image server</h2>
            <p>
              In this step you will either deploy an image server for the first time, or adapt your existing image server to
              support the IIIF. In either case your goal is to deploy an image server that fully supports delivery of images
              via URL’s as specified in the <a href="/api/image/1.1/">IIIF Image API v1.1</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              Just experimenting or trying to set up an interoperable image server for the first time?  Try one of these:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/pulibrary/loris" target="_blank">Loris</a> is an open source, Python-based image
                server that supports the IIIF Image API ver 1.1. It supports JPEG, JPEG2000 and TIFF source images.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/documentation/server/" target="_blank">IIPImage Server</a> is an open
                source Fast CGI module written in C++ that is designed to be embedded within a host web server such as Apache,
                Lighttpd, MyServer or Nginx. It supports TIFF and JPEG2000 source images. The IIIF compatible version of IIPImage
                Server can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ruven/iipsrv/tree/iiif" target="_blank">this branch</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="question">
              Do you currently have an image server based on djatoka, Aware, Luratech or FSI?
            </p>
            <p>
              These are common image server technologies that drive many image repositories in the cultural heritage community, and
              chances are that someone in the IIIF community has already built a shim or translator to make these IIIF compatible.
              Email the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iiif-discuss" target="_blank">IIIF Discuss Google Group</a>
              to find out. We will add documentation and pointers to these translators in the future.  For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This <a href="https://github.com/jronallo/djatoka" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> gem translates djatoka URI’s to IIIF-compatible URI’s.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once you have deployed your image server, we highly recommend that you <a href="http://iiif-test.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">validate it</a> to confirm that it complies with the
              IIIF Image API, and to determine its level of <a href="/api/image/compliance.html">IIIF compliance</a>.

          <!-- Step 2 -->
          <section class="step step-2 wrapper">
            <h2>Publish metadata</h2>
            <p>
              Now that you have an image server that delivers IIIF-compliant image URI’s, you need to publish metadata about your
              image-based objects using the <a href="http://www.shared-canvas.org/datamodel/iiif/metadata-api.html" target="_blank">IIIF Metadata API v1.0</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- Step 3 -->
          <section class="step step-3 wrapper">
            <h2>Deploy and integrate software</h2>
            <p>
              Now that you have an image server and published metadata its time to deploy software that makes use of the IIIF technology stack.  Ultimately
              you will want to integrate these services and supporting software into your repository infrastructure, but there are some simple ways to
              prototype IIIF support:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Deploy an image viewer that natively supports IIIF. Try to open your images in <a href="http://openseadragon.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSeadragon</a>
                or <a href="https://github.com/ruven/iipmooviewer" target="_blank">IIPMooViewer</a>, for example.
              </li>
              <li>
                Deploy a version of <a href="https://github.com/DMSTech/mirador" target="_blank">Mirador</a> and try to compare your image resources to images
                hosted by another IIIF-compatible repository.  Write the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/iiif-discuss" target="_blank">IIIF Discuss</a>
                list and we’ll supply you with sample data.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h2>Implementation Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Both the Image API <a href="/api/image/#image-info-request">Image Information Request</a> and the
                <a href="/api/metadata/">Metadata API</a> are expressed as <a href="http://json-ld.org/" target="_blank">JSON-LD</a> serializations.
              </li>
              <li>
                The goal of IIIF is to make your image resources available to web applications hosted on other domains.  Since most of the image viewers use javascript,
                your image server will need to support <a href="http://enable-cors.org/" target="_blank">cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
