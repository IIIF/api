## Abstract

This document describes an API proposed by the International Image
Interoperability Framework (IIIF) group for the delivery of images via a
standard http request. The IIIF API specifies a web service that returns
an image in response to a standard http or https request. The URL can
specify the region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format
of the requested image. A URL can also be constructed to request basic
technical information about the image to support client applications.
 The IIIF API was conceived of to facilitate systematic reuse of image
resources in digital image repositories maintained by cultural heritage
organizations. The API could be adopted by any image repository or
service, and can be used to retrieve static images in response to a
properly constructed URL.

Please send feedback to <iiif-discuss@googlegroups.com>


## 1. Audience


This document is intended for developers building applications that
share digital image assets. This includes:

-   Developers building digital image repositories who would like to
    offer services for easily sharing digital images with other
    repositories, web applications, or other software that uses images
    from the web.
-   Developers building web applications or software that want to
    retrieve images from compliant repositories.
-   A specifically targeted audience are developers and managers of
    digital image repositories, web applications and image tools at
    cultural heritage institutions, like museums, libraries and
    archives.

## 2. URL Syntax


The IIIF Image API can be called in two forms: one to request an image,
and a second to request techincal information about the image. Both
forms convey the request\'s information in the path segment of the URI,
rather than as query parameters. This makes responses more easily able
to be cached, either at the server or by standard web-caching
infrastructure. It also permits a minimal implementation using
pre-computed files in a matching directory structure.

To allow for extension, this specification does not define the behaviour
of an implementing server when it receives requests that do not match
one of the two request syntaxes below.


### 2.1 Image Request URL Syntax

The IIIF Image API URL for requesting an image MUST conform to the
following format:

{% include api/code_header.html %}
```
http[s]://server/[prefix/]identifier/region/size/rotation/quality[.format]
```

where \[\] delimits components which are optional.

The URI Template ([RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)) form
is:

{% include api/code_header.html %}
```
http://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}{.format}
```

For example:

{% include api/code_header.html %}
```
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg
```

The sections of the Image Request URL include:

| Syntax | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
  | `http (or https)`   |                        Indicates the use of the http or https protocol in calling the service. |
  | `server` |  The host server on which the IIIF-compliant image service resides. |
  | `prefix` | The path on the host server to the IIIF-compliant image service. This prefix is optional, but may be useful when the host server supports multiple services. (note: The prefix MAY contain slashes or constructions that resemble service parameters.) |
  |`identifier` |                                The unique identifier of the requested image, expressed as a string. This may be an ark, URN, filename, or other unique identifier. Special characters MUST be URI encoded.
  |`region, size, rotation, quality, format` |   Parameters defining the characteristics of the returned image. These are described in detail below.|
{: .api-table}

See [Section 4 - Image Request Parameters](#parameters).

### 2.2 Image Information Request URL Syntax

The IIIF Image API URL for requesting image information MUST conform to
the following format:

```
http[s]://server/[prefix/]identifier/info.ext
```

where \[ \] delimits the optional prefix component, \"info\" is a
literal string, and ext is one of \"json\" or \"xml\".

The URI Template ([RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)) form
is:

```
http://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/info.{ext}
```

For example:

```
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/info.json
```

See [Section 5 - Image Information Request](#info) for more information.

## 3. Identifier

The API places no restrictions on the form of the identifiers that a
server may use or support, although the identifier MUST be expressed as
a string. All special characters (e.g. ? or \#) MUST be URI encoded to
avoid unpredictable client behaviors. The URL syntax relies upon slash
(/) separators so any slashes in the identifier MUST be URI encoded
(aka. percent-encoded, replace / with %2F ). See discussion in [Section
9 - URL Encoding and Decoding.](#url_encoding)

## 4. Image Request Parameters {#parameters}


All parameters described below are required for compliant construction
of a IIIF image API URL. The sequence of parameters in the URL MUST be
in the order described below. The order of the parameters is also
intended as the order of the operations by which the service should
manipulate the image content. Thus, the image content is first extracted
as a region of the source image, then scaled to the requested size,
rotated and transformed into the color depth and format. This resulting
image content is returned as the representation for the URL. All
transformations are performed within the bounds of integer arithmatic.
 The rounding method is not specified.  Floating point numbers should be
have at most 10 decimal digits and consist only of decimal digits and
"." with a leading zero if less than 1.

### 4.1 Region

The region parameter defines the rectangular portion of the source image
to be returned. Region can be specified by pixel coordinates, percentage
or by the value "full", which specifies that the entire region of the
source image should be returned.

| Form of Region Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| `full`     |                  The complete image is returned, without any cropping. |
| `x,y,w,h `  |                 The region of the source image to be returned is defined in terms of absolute pixel values. The value of x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis. The value of y represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the vertical axis. Thus the x,y position 0,0 is the upper left-most pixel of the image. w represents the width of the region and h represents the height of the region in pixels. |
| `pct:x,y,w,h` |                The region to be returned is specified as a sequence of percentages of the source image's dimensions. Thus, x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis, calculated as a percentage of the source image's width. w represents the width of the region calculated as a percentage of the _source image's width_. The same applies to y and h respectively. These may be floating point numbers (see [Section 5 - Image Information Request](#info)). |

If the request specifies a region which extends beyond the dimensions of the source image, then the service should return an image cropped at the boundary of the source image.

If the requested region's height or width is zero, or if the region is entirely outside the bounds of the source image, then the server MUST return a 400 (bad request) status code.

Examples:\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/<span style="color: red;">80,15,60,75</span>/full/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/<span style="color: red;">pct:10,10,80,70</span>/full/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/<span style="color: red;">full</span>/full/0/native.jpg

![Illustrated examples of the region parameter](images/iiif-region.png)

### 4.2 Size

The size parameter determines the dimensions to which the extracted
region is to be scaled.

| Form of Size Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| `full`  |                   The extracted region is not scaled, and is returned at its full size. |
| `w,`    |                   The extracted region should be scaled so that its width is exactly equal to w, and the height will be a calculated value that maintains the aspect ratio of the requested region. |
| `,h`    |                   The extracted region should be scaled so that its height is exactly equal to h, and the width will be a calculated value that maintains the aspect ratio of the requested region. |
| `pct:n` |                   The width and height of the returned image is scaled to n% of the width and height of the extracted region. The aspect ratio of the returned image is the same as that of the extracted region. |
| `w,h `  |                   The width and height of the returned image are exactly w and h. The aspect ratio of the returned image MAY be different than the extracted region, resulting in a distorted image. |
| `!w,h ` |                   The image content is scaled for the best fit such that the resulting width and height are less than or equal to the requested width and height. The exact scaling MAY be determined by the service provider, based on characteristics including image quality and system performance. The dimensions of the returned image content are calculated to maintain the aspect ratio of the extracted region. |


If the resulting height or width is zero, then the server MUST return a
400 (bad request) status code.

The image server MAY support scaling beyond the full size of the
extracted region.

http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">full</span>/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">100,</span>/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">,100</span>/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">pct:50</span>/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">150,75</span>/0/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234<span style="color: red;">!150,75</span>/0/native.jpg

![Illustrated examples of the size parameter](images/iiif-size.png)

### 4.3 Rotation
{: #rotation}

The rotation value represents the number of degrees of clockwise
rotation from the original, and may be any floating point number from 0
to 360. Initially most services will only support 0, 90, 180 or 270 as
valid values.

**Examples:**

http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full<span style="color: red;">0</span>/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full<span style="color: red;">90</span>/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full<span style="color: red;">180</span>/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full<span style="color: red;">270</span>/native.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full<span style="color: red;">22.5</span>/native.jpg

![Illustrated examples of the rotation parameter](images/iiif-rotation.png)

In most cases a rotation will change the width and height dimensions of
the returned image file.  The service SHOULD return an image file that
contains all of the image contents requested in the
_region_ and _size_ parameters, even if the dimensions of the
returned image file are different than specified in the size parameter.
The image contents SHOULD NOT be scaled  as a result of the rotation,
and there SHOULD be no additional space between the corners of the
rotated image contents and the bounding box of the returned image file.

For non-90-degree rotations the API does not specify the background
color.

### 4.4 Quality

The quality parameter determines the bit-depth of the delivered image.
The quality value of native requests an image of the same bit-depth as
the source image. Values other than native are requested transformations
of the bit-depth of the source image.

| Quality Parameter | Returned |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `native` |               The image is returned at an unspecified bit-depth.|
| `color` |                The image is returned in 24-bit color.|
| `grey` |                 The image is returned in 8-bit greyscale|
| `bitonal` |              The image is returned in 1-bit bitonal|

**Examples:**

http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/<span style="color: red;">native</span>.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/<span style="color: red;">color</span>.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/<span style="color: red;">grey</span>.jpg\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/<span style="color: red;">bitonal</span>.jpg


![Illustrated examples of the quality
parameter](images/iiif-quality.png "Illustrated examples of the quality parameter")

### 4.5 Format

The format of the returned image is optionally expressed as an extension
at the end of the URL.

| Extension |   Mimetype|
| ----------- | -----------------|
| `jpg` |         image/jpeg|
| `tif` |         image/tiff|
| `png` |         image/png|
| `gif` |         image/gif|
| `jp2` |         image/jp2|
| `pdf` |         application/pdf|



**Examples:**

http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.<span style="color: red;">jpg</span>\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.<span style="color: red;">png</span>\
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.<span style="color: red;">tif</span>

If the format is not specified in the URI, then the server SHOULD use
the HTTP Accept header to determine the client's preferences for the
format. The server may either do 200 (return the representation in the
response) or 30x (redirect to the correct URI with a format extension)
style content negotiation. If neither are given, then the server should
use a default format of its own choosing.

### 4.6 Order of Implementation

The sequence of parameters in the URL is intended to express the order
in which image manipulations are made against the original. This is
important to consider when implementing the service because applying the
same parameters in a different sequence will often result in a different
image being delivered. The order is critical so that the application
calling the service reliably receives the output it expects.

The parameters should be interpreted as if the the sequence of image
manipulations were:

`Region THEN Size THEN Rotation THEN Quality THEN Format`


![Illustrated example of order of
implementation](images/iiif-order.png)

<a name="info"></a>
## 5. Image Information Request


The service MUST return technical information about the requested image
in JSON and XML formats. The request for technical information MUST
conform to the format:

`http[s]://server/[prefix/]identifier/info.xml`

or

`http[s]://server/[prefix/]identifier/info.json `

All IIIF compliant services must support both the XML and JSON response.

The response will return the following information

  | Element|                  Required?              | Description|
  | -----------------------|  ----------------------- -----------------------|
  | `identifier` | Required |    The unique identifier of the source image, expressed as a string. The identifier MUST be supplied without URI encoding. |
|  `width`                   |Required                |The width of the source image.|
|  `height`                  |Required                |The height of the source image.|
|  `scale_factors`          |Optional                |Some image servers support the creation of multiple resolution levels for a single image in order to optimize the efficiency in delivering images of different sizes. The scale_factors element expresses a list of resolution scaling factors.|
| `tile_width`             |Optional               |Some image servers support the use of predefined tiles to efficiently deliver assembled images.  The tile_width element expresses the width of the predefined tiles.|
| `tile_height `           |Optional                |The tile_height element expresses the height of the predefined tiles.|
|  `formats`                 |Optional               | The list of image format parameter values available for the image.|
|  `qualities`               |Optional               | The list of image quality parameter values available for the image.|
|  `profile`                 |Optional                |URI indicating the compliance level supported. Values as described in [Section 8. Compliance Levels](#compliance)|


The XML response should conform to the format shown in the following
example. [W3C XML](xml/image-api.xsd) and [Relax-NG](xml/image-api.rng)
schemas are available for validation.

{% include api/code_header.html %}
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<info xmlns="http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/ns/">
  <identifier>1E34750D-38DB-4825-A38A-B60A345E591C</identifier>
  <width>6000</width>
  <height>4000</height>
  <scale_factors>
    <scale_factor>1</scale_factor>
    <scale_factor>2</scale_factor>
    <scale_factor>4</scale_factor>
  </scale_factors>
  <tile_width>1024</tile_width>
  <tile_height>1024</tile_height>
  <formats>
    <format>jpg</format>
    <format>png</format>
  </formats>
  <qualities>
    <quality>native</quality>
    <quality>grey</quality>
  </qualities>
  <profile>http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html#level1</profile> 
</info>
```

The JSON response should conform to the format shown in the following
example:
{% include api/code_header.html %}
```json
{
  "identifier" : "1E34750D-38DB-4825-A38A-B60A345E591C",
  "width" : 6000,
  "height" : 4000,
  "scale_factors" : [ 1, 2, 4 ],
  "tile_width" : 1024,
  "tile_height" : 1024,
  "formats" : [ "jpg", "png" ],
  "qualities" : [ "native", "grey" ],
  "profile" : "http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html#level0" 
} 
```

## 6. Server Responses


### 6.1 Successful Responses

Servers may transmit HTTP responses with status codes 200, 302 and 304
when the request has been successfully processed.  If the status code is
200, then the entity-body MUST be the requested image or information
response.  If the status code is 302 or 304, then the entity-body is
unrestricted, but it is RECOMMENDED to be empty.  If the status code is
302, then the Location HTTP Header MUST be set containing the URL of the
image that fulfills the request.  This enables servers to have a single
canonical URL to promote caching of responses.  Status code 304 is
handled exactly as per the HTTP specification. Clients should therefore
expect to encounter all of these situations and not assume that the
entity-body of the initial response necessarily contains the image data.

### 6.2 Error Conditions

The order in which servers parse requests and detect errors is not
specified. A request will fail on the first error encountered and return
an appropriate code with more detail in the response document. Errors
are reported at the parameter level only with an option for more
detailed text.

Errors should be reported in a standard HTTP response code in the HTTP
header as follows:

| Error Code   |                Description|
| -----------------------|  -----------------------------------------------|  
  | `400 Bad Request`    |         This response is used when it is impossible for the server to fulfil the request, for example if the combination of parameters would result in a zero-sized image. In the case of a malformed URL it may not be possible to identify a failed parameter. |
  | `401 Unauthorized`    |        Authentication is required and not provided. See Section 7 below for details. |
  |`403 Forbidden`      |         The user, authenticated or not, is not permitted to perform the requested operation. |
  | `404 Not Found`       |        The image resource specified by \[identifier\] does not exist |
  | `414 URI Too Long`     |       As the specification does not support query parameters there should not be a post-amble beyond the image format specifier. However, there may be an embedded escaped URL identifier. Limit requests to 1024 characters. |
  | `415 Invalid Media`    |       Format not available (implies failure of the format specifier) |
  | `500 Internal Server Error` |  The server encountered an unexpected error that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
  | `501 Not Implemented`    |     A valid IIIF request that is not implemented by this server. If the requested format is not implemented then a 415 error should be used. |
  | `503 Service unavailable`  |   Used when the server is busy/temporarily unavailable due to load/maintenance issues. An alternative to connection refusal with the option to specify a back-off period. |


The body of the response for all error conditions should contain an XML
fragment with the parameter and optional human readable text as follows.
The Content-Type must be "text/xml".
{% include api/code_header.html %}

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <error ``xmlns="http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/ns/"``>   <parameter>size</parameter>   <text>Invalid size specified</text> </error>
```

The text element is optional and can explain the failure on more detail - for example to distinguish not implemented vs out-of-bounds in the
case of a 403.

## 7. Authentication

This API does not specify whether the image server will support
authentication or what mechanism it might use. In the case of  \"401
Unauthorized\" HTTP error response, the content of the WWW-Authenticate
header will depend on the authentication mechanism supported by the
server. If the server supports HTTP Basic or Digest authentication then
the header should follow [RFC2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617), for
example:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Images"
```

If the server supports cookie-based authentication then the response
should include the location of the page that will allow the user to
login:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Cookie location="https://example.com/login&redirect={URI}"
```


Where {URI} is a template parameter that SHOULD be used if the login
server supports redirection after login. A client MUST substitute the
current page URI in place of {URI} before presenting a login link to the
user. Note that while there is widespread agreement that the limitation
of WWW-Authenticate to Basic and Digest authentication in the current
HTTP specification, there is no standard way to indicate appropriate
redirection to a login screen, or convey a URI template to insert a
return URI.

## 8. Compliance Levels
{: #compliance}

A service SHOULD specify on all responses the extent to which the API is
supported. This is done by including an HTTP Link header
([RFC5988](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988)) entry pointing to the
description of the highest level of conformance of which ALL of the
requirements are met. The "rel" type to be used is "profile", and thus a
complete header might look like:

`Link: <http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html#level0>;rel="profile"`

An image server MAY declare different compliance levels for different
images. If the compliance level is not indicated, then a client should
assume level 0 compliance only. For detailed compliance definitions see
<http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html>.

The compliance profile URI given in the Link header (between \< and \>)
may also be returned in the profile element of responses to Image
Information Requests.

<a name="url_encoding"></a>
## 9. URL Encoding and Decoding

The URL syntax of this API relies upon slash (/) separators which MUST
NOT be encoded. Clients MUST percent-encode special characters (the
to-encode set below: percent and gen-delims of
[RFC3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) except the colon) within the
components of requests. For example, any slashes within the identifier
part of the URL MUST be percent-encoded. Encoding is necessary only for
the identifier because other components will not include special
characters.

to-encode = \"/\" / \"?\" / \"\#\" / \"\[\" / \"\]\" / \"@\" / \"%\"

Upon receiving an API request, a server MUST first split the URL path on
slashes and then decode any percent-encoded characters in each
component.

Additionally, if identifiers include any characters outside the US-ASCII
set then the encoding to octets must be defined consistently on client
and server, and the octets MUST be percent-encoded. Percent-encoding
other characters introduces no ambiguity but is unnecessary.

| Parameters | URL path (without leading http:server/\[prefix/\]) |
|----|----|
| identifier=id1 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | id1/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=id1 region=0,10,100,200 size=pct:50 rotation=90 quality=native format=png | id1/0,10,100,200/pct:50/90/native.png |
| identifier=id1 region=pct:10,10,80,80 size=50, rotation=22.5 quality=color format=jpg | id1/pct:10,10,80,80/50,/22.5/color.jpg |
| identifier=bb157hs6068 region=full size=full rotation=270 quality=grey format=jpg |    bb157hs6068/full/full/270/grey.jpg |
| identifier=ark:/12025/654xz321 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native |       ark:%2F12025%2F654xz321/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=urn:foo:a123,456 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native |          urn:foo:a123,456/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=urn:sici:1046-8188(199501)13:1%3C69:FTTHBI%3E2.0.TX;2-4 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | urn:sici:1046-8188(199501)13:1%253C69:FTTHBI%253E2.0.TX;2-4/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=http://example.com/?54\#a region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | http:%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3F54%23a/full/full/0/native|   
| identifier=id1 image information request, format=json |          id1/info.json|   
| identifier=id1 image information request, format=xml |           id1/info.xml |

Servers which are incapable of processing arbitrarily encoded
identifiers SHOULD make their best efforts to expose only image
identifiers for which typical clients will not encode any of the
characters, and thus it is RECOMMENDED to limit characters in
identifiers to letters, numbers and the underscore character.

## 10. Security Considerations

This API defines a URI syntax and the semantics associated with its
components. The composition of URIs has few security considerations
except possible exposure of sensitive information in URIs or revealing
of browse/view behavior of users.

Server applications implementing this API must consider possible
denial-of-service attacks, and authentication vulnerabilities based on
DNS spoofing. Applications must be careful to parse incoming requests
(URIs) in ways that avoid overflow or injection attacks.

Early sanity checking of URI's (lengths, trailing GET, invalid
characters, out-of-range parameters) and rejection with appropriate
response codes is recommended.

## A. Implementation Notes


1.  For use cases that enable the saving of the image, it is RECOMMENDED
    to use the HTTP Content-Disposition header
    ([RFC6266](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6266)) to provide a
    convenient filename that distinguishes the image, based on the
    identifier and parameters provided.
2.  This specification makes no assertion about the rights status of
    requested images or metadata, whether or not authentication has been
    accomplished.  Please see the IIIF Metadata API for rights
    information.  
3.  This API does not specify how image servers fulfill requests, what
    quality the returned images will have for different parameters, or
    how parameters may affect performance. See the compliance document
    for more discussion.
4.  Image identifiers that include the slash (/ %2F) or backslash (\\
    %5C) characters may cause problems with some HTTP servers. Apache
    servers from version 2.2.18 support the \"AllowEncodedSlashes
    NoDecode\" (link to
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes>)
    configuration directive which will correctly pass these characters
    to client applications without rejecting or decoding them. Servers
    using older versions of Apache and local identifiers which include
    these characters will need to use a workaround such as internally
    translating or escaping slash and backslash to safe value (perhaps
    by double URL-encoding them).
5.  As described in [Section 4.2 (Rotation)](#rotation), in order to
    retain the size of the requested image contents, rotation will
    change the width and height dimensions of the returned image file. A
    formula for calculating the dimensions of the returned image file
    for a given rotation can be found [here](rotation_calc/).
