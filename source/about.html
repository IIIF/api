            <p>Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications.</p>
            <p>A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.</p>
            <p>IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has the following goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world.</li>
              <li>To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.</li>
              <li>To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class
                user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.</li>
            </ul>
