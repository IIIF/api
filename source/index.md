## Approved extensions

Please see the [Registry of Extensions][registry] for full details on how extensions work and the process for creating them.

Currently, there are two formally published extensions available for use with the Presentation API.

| Presentation API Extensions    | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| [navPlace Extension][navPlace] | This IIIF Presentation 3 API extension defines a new property, navPlace, which is defined by earthbound geographic coordinates in the form of GeoJSON-LD. |
| [Text Granularity Extension][text-granularity] | This extension recommends a pattern for indicating the level of text granularity for an annotation related to optical character recognition (OCR) software, manual transcription, and existing digitized text. |

## Community cookbook

The [Cookbook][annex-cookbook] gathers together examples of how to create IIIF Presentation API assets, in order to:

* Provide many more examples than the specification alone can do, for reference and learning;
* Encourage publishers to adopt common patterns in modeling classes of complex objects;
* Enable client software developers to support these patterns, for consistency of user experience (when desirable); and
* Demonstrate the applicability of IIIF to a broad range of use cases.

The [Cookbook][annex-cookbook] webpages are under constant development and the list of recipes include links to completed recipes and place holders for future recipes. The community welcomes additions to the [Cookbook][annex-cookbook]. To get started, review the [Cookbook process][recipe-process] and say hello on the Cookbook [Slack][slack] channel.

## Validators


- [Image API validator]({{ site.api_url | absolute_url }}/image/validator/) - A service to validate a IIIF Image API resource against the specification.
- [Presentation API validator]({{ site.api_url | absolute_url }}/presentation/validator/service/) - A service to validate a IIIF Presentation API resource against the specification.

## Older versions

Current IIIF specifications _SHOULD_ be used for all new work. Old versions are retained for reference and are listed below. Technical resources and reference implementations of older versions are _NOT_ guaranteed to be maintained across new major versions.

## Notes

IIIF also has a series of [Implementation Notes][annex-notes] which are not subject to the same process as formal APIs but may be useful to implementers.

## Process

IIIF Specifications are created and published following the [IIIF Editorial Process][editorial-process].
