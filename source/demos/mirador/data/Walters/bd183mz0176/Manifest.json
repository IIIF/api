    "description": "This manuscript illustration of a group\n                    of youths before a king and his courtiers was executed in Iran during the early\n                    eleventh century AH / seventeenth CE. Stylistically it relates to manuscript\n                    production in Shiraz in the tenth century AH / sixteenth CE and early eleventh\n                    century AH / seventeenth CE. The painting is framed by illuminated borders in\n                    tones of gold. The back of the leaf has additional illumination and no\n                    text.
